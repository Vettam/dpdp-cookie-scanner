# dpdp-cookie-scanner

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 2fc3e0a: Register `dpdp-cookie-scanner` as a bin alias of `dpdp-cookie-scan` so `npx dpdp-cookie-scanner` can find an executable, and document `--package` in the READMEs.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 7c332cf: Fix four spec gaps: navigation failure now exits 3, C-020 ignores unknown country, --interact no longer treats a missed click as survived_reject, and the Chromium fallback actually downloads Playwright Chromium.
- 974a454: Close engine capture gaps: request initiator_host from CDP (not Referer), cookie set_by from the initiator, C10 CMP signatures in trackers/ (Osano, Quantcast), Eighth Schedule banner vocabulary, and the remaining §4.2 fingerprinting APIs plus IAB TCF legitimate-interest phrasing.
- 8ceea81: Close output/renderer spec gaps: display banner detection confidence (C-009 forced to low), phrase C-009 as "we could not find", render C-040 as the under-18 conditional, schema-validate JSON at write time, and capture notice_url for the notice-lint hand-off.
- 8a58c2f: Run the v0.1 fixture in a real browser on every `npm test` / CI job, use CookieYes selectors on the DoD page, and index the Gazette PDFs under docs/legal-sources.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 363782f: Spec v1.0: three-pass banner interaction (`--interact`), ScanResult interpretation diff (`--diff-from` / `--diff-to`), and opt-in `--fail-on settled` that never trips on arguable or open findings.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 23a3534: Close the v0.1 engine holes in spec §4: first-paint timestamps, redirect chain, banner redaction, Hindi + CMP banner detection, IndexedDB and img/font embeds, remaining fingerprinting APIs, and `--screenshot` writing a viewport PNG (never embedded in JSON).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f61260b: Add the GitHub Action wrapper (`action/`) that runs `dpdp-cookie-scan --ci`, uploads findings.json/md as an artifact, and posts or updates findings.md as a pull-request comment. Interpretation stays in the CLI.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b1b2161: Finish the v0.3 remaining items: bundled DB-IP Lite geo, Indian vendor coverage, and the community contribution guide.
  
  - Offline IP-to-country: packed DB-IP Lite (CC BY 4.0, 2026-09) in `data/geo/`. The engine stamps `destination_country` from CDP `remoteIPAddress` with no extra network call. Unclassified hosts no longer stay empty when an IP was observed.
  - Tracker dataset 0.2.0: Indian-priority vendors (Cashfree, CCAvenue, Instamojo, Juspay, Paytm, VWO, PushEngage, Netcore Smartech, Zoho SalesIQ/PageSense, Freshdesk, Freshmarketer, InMobi, Media.net, Cuelinks, ConvertCart, NotifyVisitors) on top of the v0.1 seed.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` for public contributors; `docs/contributing-rules.md` remains the legal-content review bar.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d7870a6: Release the hedged certainty tiers (arguable and open) and the v0.3 rule
  catalogue (rules/VERSION → 0.3.0).
  
  ## Arguable tier (new rules)
  - DPDP-C-010 — analytics tracker (C4) fires before consent (s.17(2)(b) statistics exemption competes).
  - DPDP-C-015 — external font/CDN request discloses visitor IP (s.8(2) processor contract is unobservable).
  - DPDP-C-030 — pseudonymous client identifier (_ga, _fbp, IDE, …) treated as personal data (s.2(t) "in relation to").
  - DPDP-C-031 — first-party cookie relies on an unstated s.7(a) basis (no strictly-necessary exemption under DPDP).
  - DPDP-C-060 — fingerprinting API calls observed (s.6(1), s.6(4)); engine now instruments canvas/audio/WebGL/WebRTC.
  - DPDP-C-061 — cookie missing Secure / HttpOnly / SameSite (Rule 6(1) reasonable security safeguards, inferred).
  - DPDP-C-062 — third-party <script> without Subresource Integrity (Rule 6(1)(g), inferred); engine now parses script tags for the integrity attribute.
  
  ## Open tier (new rules)
  - DPDP-C-020 — third-party endpoint resolves outside India. **Not a contravention**: s.16 permits transfer unless the destination is notified. The corrective rule against the GDPR-trained "cross-border = problem" assumption.
  - DPDP-C-041 — access logs as "traffic data" under the one-year retention floor (Rule 8(3)). "Traffic data" is undefined; emitted as a standing question for counsel.
  
  ## Tier correction
  - DPDP-C-050 (Sec-GPC) corrected from `arguable` to `open` to match the authoritative tier table in spec §5.3 (DPDP is silent on browser signals; no Board guidance).
  
  ## Mapper / engine
  - New `where` predicates: `is_third_party`, `destination_country`, `destination_country_not`, `cookie_name` (regex), `cookie_insecure`, `first_party`, `api` (regex), `embed_kind`, `sri`.
  - `observable: false` rules are now standing questions (always asked); `observable: true` with `needs_input` rules remain contingent questions (C-040 corrected to `observable: true`).
  - New `cookie`, `api_call`, and `embed` match branches in the mapper; `Evidence` is now the observation union so cookie/api/embed findings carry their own evidence.
  - Engine instruments fingerprinting APIs via `addInitScript` and records third-party script embeds with their SRI state.
