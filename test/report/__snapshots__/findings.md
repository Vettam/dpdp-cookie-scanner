## SETTLED (5) — enforceable 2027-05-13

<details><summary><b>DPDP-C-001</b> — Meta Platforms (meta-pixel)</summary>

- **Certainty:** settled (enforceable 2027-05-13)
- **Detection confidence:** high
- **Provisions:** s.4(1), s.5(1), s.6(1)
- **Owner:** engineering
- **Attributed to:** a tag loaded via www.googletagmanager.com
- **Rationale:** A request to a C6 vendor was observed before any consent banner was detected (or before any interaction, once interaction scans are enabled). s.6(1) requires a clear affirmative act before processing; s.5(1) requires notice to precede or accompany the consent request. Firing on page load satisfies neither. The vendor is an independent or joint Data Fiduciary for this disclosure (s.2(i)), so s.11(1)(b) also requires it to be named.

- **Remediation:** Gate the tag behind a consent signal so it does not load until an affirmative act is recorded.

<details><summary><b>DPDP-C-004</b> — Banner has an accept control but no equivalent reject control</summary>

- **Certainty:** settled (enforceable 2027-05-13)
- **Detection confidence:** high
- **Provisions:** s.6(1), s.6(4)
- **Owner:** engineering
- **Attributed to:** the consent banner
- **Rationale:** The banner exposes an accept control but no reject control. s.6(1) requires consent to be "free … unconditional"; s.6(4) requires withdrawal with ease comparable to giving. An asymmetric banner fails both.

- **Remediation:** Add a reject control of equal prominence to the accept control.

<details><summary><b>DPDP-C-007</b> — Hotjar (hotjar)</summary>

- **Certainty:** settled (enforceable 2027-05-13)
- **Detection confidence:** high
- **Provisions:** s.6(1), s.9(3)
- **Owner:** engineering
- **Attributed to:** a tag loaded via www.googletagmanager.com
- **Rationale:** A request to a C5 (session replay / heatmap) vendor was observed before any consent banner was detected. s.6(1) requires a clear affirmative act before processing. Where the site plausibly reaches under-18s, s.9(3) prohibits behavioural monitoring entirely (see DPDP-C-040).

- **Remediation:** Gate the session-replay / heatmap tag behind a consent signal; on a site reaching minors, do not load it at all.

<details><summary><b>DPDP-C-009</b> — We could not find a language option beyond English in the notice or banner</summary>

- **Certainty:** settled (enforceable 2027-05-13)
- **Detection confidence:** low
- **Provisions:** s.5(3), s.6(3)
- **Owner:** counsel
- **Attributed to:** the consent banner
- **Rationale:** No language switcher was detected on the banner and the page language is English. s.5(3) and s.6(3) require the option of English or any Eighth Schedule language. This is a heuristic — a site may offer language choice elsewhere — so detection confidence is marked accordingly and the finding is phrased as "we could not find".

- **Remediation:** Offer the notice in English plus at least the relevant Eighth Schedule languages, with a visible language control.

<details><summary><b>DPDP-C-013</b> — Hotjar (hotjar)</summary>

- **Certainty:** settled (enforceable 2027-05-13)
- **Detection confidence:** high
- **Provisions:** s.6(1)
- **Owner:** engineering
- **Attributed to:** a tag loaded via www.googletagmanager.com
- **Rationale:** A request to a C5 vendor was observed. Behavioural monitoring requires consent (s.6(1)); where children are reachable it is prohibited regardless of consent (s.9(3), see DPDP-C-040). This finding flags presence; the pre-consent variant is DPDP-C-007.

- **Remediation:** Confirm the tool is consent-gated and does not record before the affirmative act; mask sensitive fields by default.

## OPEN (2) — enforceable 2027-05-13

<details><summary><b>DPDP-C-020</b> — Meta Platforms (meta-pixel)</summary>

- **Certainty:** open (enforceable 2027-05-13)
- **Detection confidence:** high
- **Provisions:** s.16, Rule 13(4)
- **Owner:** counsel
- **Attributed to:** a tag loaded via www.googletagmanager.com
- **Rationale:** Detection: a third-party request whose resolved destination_country is not "IN". Resolution prefers the engine's request.destination_country, then the tracker dataset's destination_countries[0]. The finding is informational — it carries the note that transfer is permitted unless the destination is notified. It becomes legally live only if the Data Fiduciary is later designated an SDF.

- **Remediation:** None required by default. If the Data Fiduciary is or may be designated a Significant Data Fiduciary, assess Rule 13(4) localisation before transfer.

## QUESTIONS (2)

### DPDP-C-040 — If this site is used by people under 18, then…

- **Provisions:** s.9(3)
- **If true:** If this site reaches under-18s, switch off C5 (behavioural monitoring) and C6 (targeted advertising) for those users; consent does not cure it.

- **Rationale:** Tracking, behavioural monitoring and targeted advertising directed at children are prohibited under DPDP, and consent cannot lift that prohibition. Whether a site reaches people under 18 is something a crawler cannot see — so this is a question for you, not a finding from the scan.

- **Explainer:** https://sentinel.vettam.ai/rules/DPDP-C-040

### DPDP-C-041 — Do your server access logs (which contain visitor IPs) fall under "traffic data" as the term is used in the DPDP Rules, and if so, is the one-year retention floor in Rule 8(3) being met? The term "traffic data" is not defined in the Act or Rules; the likely anchor is the IT Act s.69B regime.


- **Provisions:** Rule 8(3), Rule 13(4)
- **If true:** Confirm whether access logs are "traffic data"; if so, retain for at least one year per Rule 8(3) and document the basis.

- **Rationale:** Rule 8(3) imposes a one-year retention floor for "traffic data". The term is not defined in the Act or the Rules; the likely anchor is the IT Act s.69B regime. Whether server access logs (which contain visitor IP addresses) are "traffic data" is therefore an open question. This rule is unobservable from the page and is put to counsel as a question.

- **Explainer:** https://sentinel.vettam.ai/rules/DPDP-C-041

## Limits

- Server-side tagging, backend relays, logs and retention are not observable by a crawler.
- Consent-banner interaction was not performed; findings reflect the page state before any user action.
- This is a reading of the DPDP Act and Rules, not legal advice and not a compliance verdict.
