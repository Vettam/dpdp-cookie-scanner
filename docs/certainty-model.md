# The certainty model

Every finding carries two orthogonal axes. There is no severity field.

## Certainty tier (interpretive confidence)

| Tier | Meaning | Test |
|---|---|---|
| `settled` | The text of the Act or Rules is clear and its application to this observation needs no interpretation. | A competent lawyer would not hedge. |
| `arguable` | The provision applies, but its application to this fact pattern is contestable. | A competent lawyer would say "probably, but…" and give reasons. |
| `open` | No Board guidance, no case law, the text is silent or undefined; resolved by future orders. | A competent lawyer would say "nobody knows yet". |

## Enforceability (temporal status)

`enforceable_from: <ISO date>` on every rule. Most substantive obligations under the Act commence **13 May 2027**. A finding whose rule is not yet enforceable is still reported; the date is shown beside it. This axis is separate from certainty because a provision can be perfectly clear and not yet in force.

## Observability

`observable: true | false` on every rule. Unobservable rules (retention, server-side tagging, log handling) never produce findings from the engine alone. They produce **questions** in the report and are wired to the hosted tool's questionnaire.

## Why certainty, not severity

India has no cookie law. The relevance of a cookie scan under DPDP rests on an inference chain (see the spec §0.3). Some links in that chain are settled, some arguable, some open. The tool's job is to show which is which. Severity would be a product judgement; certainty is a reading of the law, and the reading is versioned and citable.
